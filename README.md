## Lessons Learned

This project was more challenging than I thought it would be. The designing alone took a full day. However, the experience was extremely rewarding and I am getting that much better with CSS and HTML for designing purposes. The javascript was easy in some parts and hard in some parts. There was a lot of trial and error in determining in which iteration I needed to invoke what function to trigger proper timing so the quiz would behave like I wanted it to. Overall, very satisfied with work as I can see the improvements I am making.
